# Command: alloc-status

The `alloc-status` command displays status information and metadata about an
existing allocation and its tasks. It can be useful while debugging to reveal
the underlying reasons for scheduling decisions or failures, as well as the
current state of its tasks.

## Usage

```
nomad alloc-status [options] <allocation>
```

An allocation ID or prefix must be provided. If there is an exact match, the
full details of the allocation will be displayed. Otherwise, a list of matching
allocations and information will be displayed.

## General Options

<%= general_options_usage %>
#
## Status Options

* `-short`: Display short output. Shows only the most recent task event.

## Examples

Short status of an alloc:

```
$ nomad alloc-status --short a7365fe4-8b9f-4284-612d-a101fb41e773
