# Command: node-drain

The `node-drain` command is used to toggle drain mode on a given node. Drain
mode prevents any new tasks from being allocated to the node, and begins
migrating all existing allocations away.

The [node-status](/docs/commands/node-status.html) command compliments this
nicely by providing the current drain status of a given node.

## Usage

```
nomad node-drain [options] <node>
```

A node ID or prefix must be provided. If there is an exact match, the
drain mode will be adjusted for that node. Otherwise, a list of matching
nodes and information will be displayed.

It is also required to pass one of `-enable` or `-disable`, depending on which
operation is desired.

## General Options
